            I am a passionate Software Engineer. I have tried to balance both my academic and skill development in my undergrad period. I've learned different JavaScript technologies (eg. Express, Node, React, Rest API) and front-end frameworks (Bootstrap, Material-UI). I have spent most of my time in skill development either it's academic or non-academic. I am skilled in making digital illustrations and video editing software. I think I am a quick learner and ready to explore more.
